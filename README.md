# CarApp

A project for Advanced Software Engineering course. This project is a RESTFUL API implemented using Java and spring boot, It provides a car booking service that helps passengers to choose a driver from a list of those drivers that accepted his ride request. They can meet at a specific location and start the ride. 

**The system is divided into four main parts.**
<br>**Customer subsystem** 
<br>This subsystem contains most of the classes upon which any of the system users (Passengers, Drivers, Admins) depend in order for them to get their needs done.

<br>**Data subsystem**
<br>This subsystem contains all the classes that has to do with saving or manipulating any of our system's data. This system depends on arraylists to save the data, But a database management system can be used at any time interchangebly with these arraylists.

<br>**Event subsystem**
<br>This subsystem contains the classes responsible for tracking all the events that take place within the system.

<br>**Ride subsystem**
<br>This subsystem contains the classes that are responsible for the ride management and the driver's offers.
